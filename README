You'll need a recent version of the JRE to run the program. The JDK and the 
'ant' build tool if you want to use the build.xml file to build files from 
source. However, a binary is included.

Description of directories:
build - Used by ant for compiled source files
dist - The compiled tdg09.jar library
etc - Protein sequence alignments and tree files for influenza genes
lib - Libraries used by tdg09
src - Java source files for tdg09

To run the program, select the appropriate (matching) alignment and tree files
and pass these as command-line arguments to the run.sh program. For example,

./run.sh etc/H1.faa etc/H1.tree

for the H1 gene. Or

./run.sh etc/MP.faa etc/MP.tree

for the MP gene.
